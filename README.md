Writing reports for laboratories is quite exhausting, so I decided to automate the process as much as possible.

I wish to include option such as:
* Generating table with measured values in LaTeX
* Calculating average of data set, standard deviation of average from data set
* Generating graphs
* Writing necessary calculations
